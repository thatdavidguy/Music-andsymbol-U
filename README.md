# Music-&-U
Music &amp; U a collection of APIs and python libraries to judge your character based on your music preferences.
Do note that this is so far mainly the transformation part of our ETL process from our survey.

Our main goal was to extract information from a song just by it's title and find
correlation between the sentiment of the top 3 songs people listen to and the level of extraversion/introversion

Our final analysis of the data concluded that about 5% of level of extraversion/introversion can be attributed to those who listen to 'sad' music
although further research is needed.
